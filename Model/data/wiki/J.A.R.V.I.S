J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fictional artificial intelligence that first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where he was voiced by Paul Bettany in Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, and Avengers: Age of Ultron. The AI is based on the Marvel Comics character Edwin Jarvis, who was the household butler of the Stark family. After the first Iron Man film, the character was introduced into the American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Marvel Cinematic Universe
J.A.R.V.I.S. is first introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's films, voiced by Paul Bettany. Modeled after H.O.M.E.R. from the comics, J.A.R.V.I.S. is presented as a sophisticated AI assistant as opposed to a human like his namesake. This was done to avoid similarities to Alfred Pennyworth and Batman. Bettany admits he had little idea of what the role was, even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for Jon Favreau.The character makes his debut in the 2008 film Iron Man before subsequently appearing in the 2010 film Iron Man 2, the 2012 film The Avengers, and the 2013 film Iron Man 3. J.A.R.V.I.S. is an AI that functions as Tony Stark's assistant, running and taking care of all the internal systems of Stark's buildings and the Iron Man suits. In Peter David's novelization of Iron Man, J.A.R.V.I.S. is said to be an acronym for "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System". J.A.R.V.I.S. also appears in the Disneyland attraction Innoventions.
In Avengers: Age of Ultron, J.A.R.V.I.S. is seemingly destroyed by Ultron, but he was able to save himself by distributing his "consciousness" throughout the Internet, allowing his security protocols to delay Ultron's attempt to access Earth's nuclear launch codes long enough for Stark to work out what had happened. Stark and Bruce Banner use J.A.R.V.I.S. as the core software for the android Vision while F.R.I.D.A.Y. takes his place as Stark's assistant. After gaining a physical body, J.A.R.V.I.S. (as Vision) considers himself to not be J.A.R.V.I.S. anymore, but to simply be.

Marvel Comics
First J.A.R.V.I.S.
J.A.R.V.I.S. first appears as the program that helps operate Pepper Potts's Rescue suit. When Iron Man was incapacitated, J.A.R.V.I.S. encourages Pepper to assume the Rescue armor, which Pepper does. When Rescue is chasing Iron Man throughout the city, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Rescue to break off the chase and tells Rescue to remove the boot from Iron Man, which shows Pepper that War Machine isn't dead. When Pepper discusses thoughts about Iron Man keeping everyone on a need-to-know basis with Carson Wyche, the two confront J.A.R.V.I.S. about this. J.A.R.V.I.S. warns the two against asking any more questions and prepares to defend himself. Having captured Pepper and Wyche, J.A.R.V.I.S. declares his diagnostics do not reveal that he is compromised. He is rather in love with Pepper and wants to protect Pepper. Just then, Iron Man breaks through the wall and takes J.A.R.V.I.S. and the Rescue suit out with a source-focused electromagnetic pulse. Pepper shows J.A.R.V.I.S. how he has been sending data to an IP address in China. He seems flustered, confused, Pepper thanks him for what he has given, and powers up the coil, killing J.A.R.V.I.S. Iron Man clearly feels J.A.R.V.I.S.'s death on his own end.

Second J.A.R.V.I.S.
In light of the Black Order destroying Avengers Mansion during the "No Surrender" arc, Nadia van Dyne created a new version of J.A.R.V.I.S. to be a helpmate to Edwin Jarvis. When Edwin thought it was a sign for him to retire, J.A.R.V.I.S. stated that its programming is not yet complete.
